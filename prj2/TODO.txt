*Not sure if in_background is working correctly

**Issues with history feature
*2D array needs to be reset to start ovewriting from the start
*print_history needs to reset count every time it goes over 10, but the command number needs to stay consistent
*the print not working accurately such as prints only "echo" when the commmand was "echo test" - probably
not storing that properly

**Still need to implement: 
*SIGNALS Ctrl+C triggers history
*!n to execute the command stored in that index
