One group of threads will model candy factories which generate candy one at a
time and insert the candy into the bounded buffer. Another group of threads will
model kids which eat candy one a time1 from the bounded buffer.

 Your program, called candykids, will accept three arguments:
â€¢ ./candykids <#factories> <#kids> <#seconds>

1)Create main stuff (extract args + initialize modules)
2)Create Candy Factory (that will create candy that will be stored in bounded buffer)
3)Buffer 
4)Create kids thread
5)Everything needs to be created first
6)Factory waits on candy to be produced
7)Consume candy while there is candy in BB
8)Kids get canceled and join thread.
9)Make statistics (at some phase)
